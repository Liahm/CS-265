First I have to say, happy holidays. Second, the tables are on the excel
file.
Q1
Used data from example
F(n) is going upwards to infinity so, w(f(n)
F(n^3) is heading to 0, is o(f(n))
f(n^2) is also heading to 0 is o(f(n))
used f(log2(n)) It would stay on an average of 1.80E-5 until the ins.80000
This hold the same for almost every number

Q2
F(n) has a cap at around 5.4e+3
F(n^2) tends toward zero
F(n^3) tends towards zero
Using f(log2(n)) the number would be 3.44E+2 almost all tests.
