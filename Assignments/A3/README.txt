Input files will be either input.infix. If it doesn't work because of bad coding of the file location a manual input exists.
Only one step was not performed because I am bad:
-If it is an operator, then pop operators from the stack and append to the postfix expression while the operators have equal or higher precedence than the current token. Push current token (operator) onto the stack. 
So outputs will not look correct
My ant should compile all the files given plus my main file and create a javadoc(code from example).
