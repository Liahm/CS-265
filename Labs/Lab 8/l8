Q1.1
	i)Hide implementation details means to hide or make invisible the details
to the user such that the implementations are there, but not visible and
will not affect the users.
	ii)Don't have functions that do the same task multiple times.
	iii)You can do only what you can see.
	iv)If my link to X website inside the webiste blinks whenever I hover
over it, then every link should do the same.

Q1.2
Empty fields, max (char buf) is 200, max char* field is 20. Commas inside
quotes line 21(I think? that's the line) (p=strtok(q, ",\n\r")... It would
print q, follow by new line. Which would take out the "getLINE" part.

Q1.3
It's bigger now?(DON'T TAKE THAT SERIOUS PLEASE)
Size of line and buf is not limited anymore.
Additional functions were added such as endofline and reset.
Multiple field separator support


Q1.4
Two CSV files can't be parse at the same time because only one of them
exists at a time. Only one line variable exists such that parsin can't read
from stdin.
I like that one short function called csvnfield. It returns nfield. Isn't
this function useless in a way?

Q1.5
It will allow to read from stdin, so yes.
It also returns more reasonable values, int rather than pointers to
position.
I don't see any issues.

Q1.6
It hides implementation details, it choose a smal orthogonal set of
primitives, it doesn't reach behind the users back and does the same thing
everywhere.

Q1.7
Tried doin it, failed. 0 points for Q7
