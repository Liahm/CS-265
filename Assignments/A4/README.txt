Happy Holidays to whoever is reading this.

The application MIGHT not run at the start because of the file name. I didn't know how to do it with the $ACCT_LIST.
First, I had to change code from version 3.5.2 to 2.7.12. My fault, I didn't read the intructions correctly.
Second, if any data is added that isn't what is asked, there is a chance of error. Example, if you input user 9, and there are only 8, error. Couldn't fix this on version 2.7.12
Third, ./accounts -any input will only run the program and you will have to retype -i, -h, -t, -?.
