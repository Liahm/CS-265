Q1 Variable of true = 0 and variable of false = 1 which are the same as what
they mean.

Q2
int IsSmaller(char *first, char *second) {
	if(strcmp(first, second) < 1)
		return 1l
	else
		return 0;
	}

Q3 I read it outloud, didn't make sense.

Q4
	a) if(c!= 'y' || c!= 'Y')
			return;
	b) if(length > BUFSIZE)
			length = BUFSIZE;
	c) flag = !flag;
	d) quote = 0;
			if(strcmp(*line, '"') == 0)
				quyote = 1;
	e) bit = (val & 1) ? : 0;

Q5 The order of read method is unknown to us. Also the code is unclear due
to the naming throughout the program.

Q6 2 3

Q7
	a) if (!stty(stdin) && !istty(stdout) && !istty(stderr))
	return 0;

	b) return retval 
	
	c) 	for (k=0; k<4; k++) {
			scanf("%lf", &dx);
			x += dx;
		}

Q8
	for (int count=0; count<total; count++) {
		if (this.getName(count) == nametable.userName()) {
			return (true);
	}
}

Q9 There are no parenthesis around the variable 'c' inside the statement. And since 'c' occurs multiple times throughout the macro, it will be executed multiple times.

Q10 
#define METER_PER_FEET 0.3048

#define FEET_PER_MILE 5280.0
#define KILOMETER_PER_MILE 1.609344
#define SQUARE_KM_PER_SQUARE_MILE 2.589988

Q11
1st - States that a void function returns a value. A void function shouldn't
return any value.

2nd - the % operator is used for mod 2 to find if even or not, but does not mention the 'MAX' variable.

3rd - States that a message should be printed out, It feels that the comment
is in an random area since there is no code above or belo or before the
comment. It's unclear what it would print

4th - A duplicate of the 5th comment.

5th - Plus 1 to a line counter.

6th - Same as 5th comment.
